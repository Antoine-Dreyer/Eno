# Eno â€“ Questionnaire generator

Eno is a tool that generates survey questionnaires starting from their formal description in [DDI](http://ddialliance.org/).

Due to its modular design, Eno can create questionnaires in different formats from the same DDI description. Currently, Eno generates XForms web questionnaires that can be executed on [Orbeon Forms Runner](http://www.orbeon.com/). PDF questionnaires is under development.
